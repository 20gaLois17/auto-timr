# auto-timr

## Note

Please do not use this repo, as of now it is highly customised to my personal workflow and might not work for you.
Also this script is a complete hack due to the fact that I intend to save time (and nerves) for the matter. 

## But why? 
Because I ...
1) prefer terminal based workflows :heavy_check_mark:
2) keep my project times in a flat file :heavy_check_mark:
3) like to have my project times thouroughly documented :heavy_check_mark:
4) hate to use the timr webclient with a passion :heavy_check_mark: :heavy_check_mark:


## ?Todo?
- Documentation
- Basic Auth
- Working Times

## Requirements
- Python3 

```
pip install python-dotenv
```
